To automate the restart of your processes when the server restarts, you can use a process manager like PM2. PM2 is a popular tool for managing and monitoring Node.js applications. It allows you to keep your applications running continuously, even after server reboots.

Here's how you can set up PM2 to manage your three NestJS processes:


1. Install PM2 Globally:
npm install -g pm2


2. Create PM2 Configuration File:
Create a ecosystem.config.js file in the root of your project. This file will define the configuration for your processes.


module.exports = {
    apps: [
        {
            name: 'system',
            script: './scripts/start_system.sh',
            cwd: __dirname, // Set the correct path
            wait_ready: true, // Wait for the ready signal
            listen_timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds to wait for the ready signal
        },
        {
            name: 'warehouse',
            script: './scripts/start_warehouse.sh',
            cwd: __dirname, // Set the correct path
            wait_ready: true, // Wait for the ready signal
            listen_timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds to wait for the ready signal
        },
        {
            name: 'api-gateway',
            script: './scripts/start_api_gateway.sh',
            cwd: __dirname, // Set the correct path
            wait_ready: true, // Wait for the ready signal
            listen_timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds to wait for the ready signal
            env: {
                PM2_SERVE_WAIT: 'system,warehouse' // Ensure it starts after system and warehouse
            }
        }
    ]
};





3. Start Your Applications with PM2:
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js


4. Save the PM2 Process List:
pm2 save


5. Enable PM2 Startup Script:
Generate and configure a startup script to run PM2 and your applications on server boot.
pm2 startup




====================================================================




If you want to disable PM2 from starting your applications on boot, you can use the following commands to remove the PM2 startup scripts and stop the processes.

1. Remove PM2 Startup Scripts:
To disable PM2 startup scripts, use the unstartup command. This will remove the startup configuration for PM2.

pm2 unstartup



2. Stop and Delete PM2 Processes:
To stop and delete all PM2 managed processes, use the following commands:
pm2 stop all
pm2 delete all





============================================================================

Check PM2 Status:
pm2 status
