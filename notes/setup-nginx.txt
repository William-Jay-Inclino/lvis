Setting up Nginx on your Ubuntu server involves several steps. Here's a basic guide to get you started:



1. Update Your Package Index: Ensure your package index is up-to-date by running:
sudo apt update

2. Install Nginx: Use apt to install Nginx:
sudo apt install nginx


3. Start Nginx: Once installed, start the Nginx service:
sudo systemctl start nginx


4. Enable Nginx: Enable Nginx to start on boot:
sudo systemctl enable nginx


5. Verify Installation: Check if Nginx is running by visiting your server's public IP address in a web browser. You should see the Nginx default welcome page.


6. Configure Firewall: If you have a firewall enabled (e.g., UFW), allow Nginx's HTTP and HTTPS traffic:
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'


7. Access Nginx Default Configuration: Nginx's main configuration file is located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. The default site configuration is usually found in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.


8. Managing Nginx: You can start, stop, or restart Nginx using the following commands:
sudo systemctl start nginx    # Start Nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx     # Stop Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx  # Restart Nginx



9. Configuration: Edit Nginx's configuration files as needed. Make sure to test any changes and reload Nginx to apply them:
sudo systemctl reload nginx



10. Logs: Nginx logs can be found in /var/log/nginx/.





Remember to adjust your firewall settings and Nginx configurations based on your specific needs and server setup.
